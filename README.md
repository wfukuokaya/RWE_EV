## Multicenter retrospective observational study of the effectiveness of enfortumab vedotin for metastatic urothelial carcinoma in the real-world setting

This repository contains the R code used for analyzing the effectiveness of enfortumab vedotin (EV) in patients with treatment-resistant advanced urothelial cancer in a real-world setting. The study is based on data from a multicenter observational study of 103 evaluable patients.

### Objectives
The main objectives of this study were to:

* Explore the characteristics of patients with advanced urothelial cancer treated with EV.
* Assess the effectiveness of EV in terms of radiographic response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
* Evaluate the treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) associated with EV.

### Methods
* Patients: 103 evaluable patients with advanced urothelial cancer who received EV.
* Outcomes: Assessed by radiographic response, PFS, and OS, with trAEs evaluated.
* Assessment Tools: Radiographic response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, while trAEs were studied in line with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.

### Results
* Median follow-up: 8.9 months.
* Objective response rate: 50.5%.
* Median PFS: 6.0 months (95% CI: 4.7–9.8).
* Median OS: 14.5 months (95% CI: 12.4–not reached).
* trAEs: 26 patients (25.2%) reported 49 trAEs, with 9 (18.3%) being grade 3 or higher.

### Conclusions
The study demonstrates that EV shows robust anti-tumor activity and has a manageable safety profile in the treatment of previously treated advanced urothelial cancer outside the clinical trial setting.
